======
A free and open source social network based on the philosophy of Kopimism.

Groups are currently the main focus with a proposal system that lets members collaboratively change the groups structure by way of vote, allowing for unlimited customization. Proposals let members add modules that can serve as software add ons or web apps for the group. Members can even decide to request a federation with another group, allowing for shared resources to be managed between multiple groups. Various goods or services, called shares will make up the sharing economy, allowing members to amass resources in common to the group or federation as a whole.

The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized social structure for a more free and open society.
