======
A free and open source social network based on the philosophy of Kopimism.

Groups are currently the main focus with a proposal system that lets members collaboratively change the groups structure by way of vote, allowing for unlimited customization. Proposals let members add modules that can serve as software add ons or web apps for the group. Members can even decide to request a federation with another group, allowing for shared resources to be managed between multiple groups. Various goods or services, called shares will make up the sharing economy, allowing members to amass resources in common to the group or federation as a whole.

The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized social structure for a more free and open society.

This code base can also be used to easily deploy custom social networks, soon with a control panel allowing for mamagement of optional features like advertisements and other capabilities that may or may not appear on the main site. Kopimia.com will adhere to the principles of the Kopimist philosophy while custom domains can implement whatever rules or features the administrator so desires. Starting out as a simple blogging platform, you can add more and more features, at your own pace, such as user accounts, allowing for users to comment and even create groups around your central topic.
