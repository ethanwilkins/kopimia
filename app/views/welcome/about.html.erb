		<h2>Kopimia</h2>
		
		<p class="about_text">A free and open source social network based on the philosophy of Kopimism.</p>

		<p class="about_text">Groups are currently the main focus, with a proposal system that lets members collaboratively change the groups structure by way of majority vote, allowing for unlimited customization. Proposals let members add modules that can serve as feature add ons or web apps for the group. Members can even decide to request federations with other groups, allowing for modules and shared resources to be managed between multiple groups. Various goods or services, called shares will make up the sharing economy, allowing members to share and amass resources in common to the group or federation as a whole.</p>

		<p class="about_text">Ultimately, this code base will be capable of rapidly deploying custom social networks, soon with a control panel allowing for mamagement of feature sets optimized specifically for your needs, including advertisements and other capabilities. Starting out as a simple blogging platform, you can add more and more features, at your own pace, such as user accounts, allowing for friends and colleages to post, comment, and even create groups; all the while building up your own custom social network.</p>

		<p class="about_text">The goal of this project is to provide a decentralized social structure for a more free and open society.</p></br>
